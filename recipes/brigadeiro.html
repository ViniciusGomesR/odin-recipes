        <p>A classic Brazilian sweet that is practical and simple to prepare at any time! Check out how to make it now!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can of condensed milk.</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons of powdered chocolate or chocolate chips (preferably good quality).</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of butter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the condensed milk can and empty the contents into a thick-bottomed pan.</li>
            <li>Add the chocolate powder (or pieces). Mix well.</li>
            <li>Add the butter and heat the mixture over low heat. You have to stir all the time, until you see the mixture come out of the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>As soon as you reach the point, remove the pan from the heat and place the contents in a heat-resistant dish (if you can, you can grease it with butter in advance), wait for it to cool down and you can consume it.</li>
        </ol>
